Especially when Zomato Gold is here, which comes with complimentary benefits—one free dish for a collective order by a Zomato Gold member—and there are way too many places serving awesome cuisines.</p>

                <p>Those in Delhi NCR, let us help you out with the ultimate list of spots where you can enjoy some of the so-called non-conventional cuisines. What’s awesomer is the fact that all these restaurants feature on Zomato Gold.</p>

                If you thought Dubai was the ultimate place to be in the UAE, Abu Dhabi strictly begs to differ. They’ve got some of the hippest bars, pubs, and restaurants where you can hang out till the wee hours of the night. Don’t even get us started on the kinds of beer and cocktails these guys whip up. And with Zomato Gold, you know you’re in for a party every day of the week. If you don’t know what Zomato Gold is, it’s an exclusive subscription-based service. And Gold users benefit from the complimentary nature of the service; they get one drink free for every drink purchased (up to 2 drinks). It could be any drink of any choice and at any given time. In other words, unlimited happy hours greet them at all the restaurants and bars that are featured on Zomato Gold.
